       <h1>A Celebration of Rivalry Week</h1>

       <p class=paragraph>Twice per year, the greatest Rivalry in all of the world 
           meets to battle it out on the court.
           Many believe the Duke-UNC Rivalry has been going on since the beginning 
           of time. Contrary to popular belief, it hasn't... but pretty close. 
           Duke-UNC played their first game 
           against one another on January 24, 1920 and have played eachother at 
           least once per year ever since then. </p>
           <br>
           <p>Like, damn.</p>
<br>
        <p class=paragraph>Although Duke doesn't share that strong of a rivalry with any another
        Atlantic Coast Conference team, we have played
        almost all the same several teams for years. Crazies fill Cameron, bodies are painted, and eardrums are permanantly damaged.
        Welcome to Cameron Indoor.</p>
<br>
        <p class=paragraph>This visual representation of data shows the wins and losses of the Duke
            University Blue Devil's men's basketball team over the past seven years, not including the current 2017-18 season. 
            The teams represented below are Boston College, 
            Clemson, Florida State, Georgia Tech, Louisville, Miami, North Carolina State,
            Notre Dame, Pitt, Syracuse, UNC, Virginia State, Virginia Tech, and Wake Forest.
            We have played each of these teams at least once in each of the last seven season.</p>
<br>
            <p class=paragraph>There is a blue and black circle for <i>each of the 14 teams</i>. The blue circle
            corresponds to <i>the number of times Duke has beat the team labelled on the circle</i>. 
            The size of the black circles correspond to <i>the number of times Duke has lost to that team</i>.
